# Hi there, I'm Orazio P. Petito ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## ðŸŒŸ About Me

### ðŸŽ“ Education & Passions
I'm a **sophomore studying Computer Science** at **Cornell University** with a **minor in Business**. My passion lies in **software engineering** and **quantitative finance**. I strive to develop innovative solutions that leverage technology to drive financial efficiency and innovation. My goal is to bridge the gap between software engineering and quantitative finance, contributing to impactful projects that utilize data and machine learning to solve complex financial challenges.

### ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience
I'm currently finishing up an internship with **LinkedIn**, where I was tasked with creating a networking tool to increase user engagement and experience. In this role, I led a cross-functional team of four and developed **LinkedIn Rooms**, a real-time professional networking tool using live audio. This feature provides opportunities for one-on-one conversations with recruiters and influencers, fostering personable and memorable relationships that might otherwise not be possible.

I am also starting an internship with **Dasion**, an AI/ML healthcare startup, where I will be working on cutting-edge projects at the intersection of technology and healthcare.

### âš½ Hobbies & Personal Interests
Outside of coding and finance, I enjoy playing rugby for Cornell's Rugby team, participating in pickup soccer games, going to the gym, and diving into a good book. Additionally, I love playing the guitar and exploring new technologies in my free time.
