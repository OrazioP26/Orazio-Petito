# Hi there, I'm Orazio P. Petito ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## ðŸŒŸ About Me
I'm a **sophomore studying Computer Science** at **Cornell University** with a **minor in Business**. My passion lies in **software engineering** and **quantitative finance**. I strive to develop innovative solutions that leverage technology to drive financial efficiency and innovation. I aim to bridge the gap between software engineering and quantitative finance, contributing to impactful projects that utilize data and machine learning to solve complex financial challenges.
I'm currently finishing up an internship with linkedin where I was tasked with creating a networking tool to help increase user engagement and experience. From this I led a cross-functional team of four and created **LinkedIn Rooms**, a real time proffesional netowrking tool via live audio that gives opportunities to have a one on one conversation with recruiters or influencers creating personable and memorable relations that otherwise would otherwise not be possible.
I'm currently starting an internship with Dasion, an AI/ML healthcare startup
Outside of coding and finance, I love spending time playing rugby for Cornell's Rugby team and some pickup soccer, going to the gym, and diving into a good book.
